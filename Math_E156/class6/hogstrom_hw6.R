### Part 1 



### Part 2 
# p.132 - #12
# FishMercury --> mercury ppm for 30 fish cought in Minesota
# a) Historgram and boxplot of data - what do you observe?
# b) Bootstrap the mean and record the bootstrap standard error and the 
# 95% confidence interval
# c) Remove the ouutlier and bootstrap the mean of the remaining data. record
# the bootstrap standard error and the 95% bootstrap interval.
# d) what effect did removing the outlier have on the bootstrap distribution,
# in particular, the standard error?


### Part 3
# Bookprices --> hardcover textbook prices

# a) Perform some exploratory data analysis on book prices for each 
# of the thwo disciplinary areas

# b) Bootstrap the mean of book price for each area separetly and 
# describe the distributions

# c) Bootstrap the ratio of means. Provide plots of the bootstrap distributionand 
# describe the distribution.

# d) Find the 95% bootstrap percentile interval for the ratio of means. Interpret
# this interval

# e) What is the bootstarp estimate of the bias? What fraction of the 
# bootstrapstandard error does it represent?

### Part 4

# Of the students who entered Harvard as freshmen in Fall 1997, 41 of 819 men 
# and 23 of 756 women failed to graduate within 5 years. Conduct a bootstrap 
# analysis, in the manner of Example 5.7, of the relative risk of failing to 
# graduate within five years based on gender. Include a plot like figure 5.17 
# that illustrates the bootstrap percentile confidence interval for the 
# relative risk.
