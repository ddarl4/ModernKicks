# 1. Exercises 3 and 4 on page 323. Partial answers to 3 are on page 323. 
# Editing script 10A will solve this problem pretty quickly.



# 2. Exercise 5 on page 324. Answers on page 323. Note that part (a) is 
# fre- quentist, not Bayesian. You can get a good approximate answer in one
#  line by using qbinom(). I cannot figure out how to get exactly the same
#   confidence interval as on page 323, even by going to page 192 (which we
#    have not covered yet) and using prop.test.

#general social survey
# 295/1324 people think we spend too little on the military

# a) find a 90% confidence interval for the true proportion of 
# people who think that the government spends too little on the military

# b) A Bayesian analyst thinks that the true proporition has a beta
# distribution with a mean of 0.3 and a s.d. of 0.02. Find a 90% credible interval
# for the true proportion


# # 3. Exercise 15 on page 326. Parts (a) and (b) are not really R problems, 
# but after you solve them, you can have R plot graphs of the prior and
#  posterior distributions for Î¸.
