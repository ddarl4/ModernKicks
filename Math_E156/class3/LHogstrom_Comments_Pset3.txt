Great pset! Just be careful to doublecheck exactly what we're asking for.

Problem 1.

a) These histograms are wicked hard to read- try playing around with  plot.ecdf() for this kind of thing

b) I'd be careful about exactly what probability you're looking at. You want cases that are more extreme than the one you saw- 
in this case, I believe that means cases where result <= homefield....I'm going to play with this one a bit and hopefully once I post answers it will shed some light

 
Problem 2.

Line 52 -- exactly. Specifically, the expected value in adult-bottom is <5

This looks great

Problem 3.

a) Very well done (you're one of the few people who interpreted this the way the book meant)

b) Again, nicely done

One note: when you're doing two-sided tests, you can really only assert that difference differs from 0 (or...whatever your alternative hypothesis is)
Which seems silly in cases like this, but by the nature of two-sided tests you're looking at both tails of the test-statistic's distribution. 
This is why it's sometimes (politically speaking) considered "cheating" to run a one-way test if you don't have a specific reason to believe your alternative hypothesis is directional in a particular way.
Having said that....the one-way test here is clearly significant, and the direction is obvious. 

Problem 4.

a) This approach is good, but you're looking at 5 or more wins as opposed to 4 or more (see definition, in the instructions, of "finishing strong")
b) we wanted you to use the hypergeometric rather than multinomial here

c) Looks great

d) Once again, this works perfectly if you're looking for 5+ wins

Problem 5.

Looks good
